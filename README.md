## Object Oriented Programming in Java - Coursera

This repository contain the work I have done with regard to the **Object Oriented Programming in Java** course in Coursera under the specialization, **Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures**. The final project for this course consist of a map application that gives a visual representation of earthquake information. The earthquake information is obtained in real time, organized according to their magnitude, and represented in a GUI. The project uses the Unfolding library (http://unfoldingmaps.org/). 

## Notes on Using the Code

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

### Installation

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')

### Manual Installation

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src

### Troubleshooting

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
